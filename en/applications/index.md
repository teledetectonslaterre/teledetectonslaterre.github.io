<center><h2>Agriculture</h2></center>
Remote sensing gives farmers and scientists an original point of view on croplands. It helps them track the lands' needs and their evolution. From the lack of water to the outburst and consequences of diseases, satellite and aerial images enbales us to detect all sorts of events.

<center><h2>Archeology</h2></center>
The first step of any archeological dig is to make a map of the area in which the excavation will take place and to take pictures in order to know the specific location of any discovery. Remote sensing helps archeologists do both and has become an essential tool for them.

<center><h2>Environmental protection</h2></center>
When it comes to protecting the environment, remote sensing offers an undeniable advantage, as it allows observation without contact! Satellite images obviously provide a view of remote areas, but they also provide information that the human eye would not be able to detect.

<center><h2>Journalism</h2></center>
Remote sensing, particularly through satellite imagery, allows journalists to access places they cannot visit in person. It also provides an overview of large areas. In addition, the development of remote sensing image archives opens a window onto how the landscape has changed over several years.

Many museums and historical or cultural sites use geographic information in presenting their heritage. For example, geographic information played an important role in Nice being added to UNESCO's World Heritage List. It is not a specific building that makes the city unique, but rather its architectural ensemble. Reading maps and taking a virtual or physical stroll through the city therefore allows visitors to understand the richness of this urban heritage.<br><br>
