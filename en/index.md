<strong><em>What is remote sensing? What is geomatics?</em></strong><br><br>

One has to admit these are not questions one thinks about everyday. Nevertheless, geomatics enables us to overcome multiple obstacles on a daily basis and remote sensing gives us insight on objects and phenomena we would not even have imagined !

How many of us dreamed of travelling like Alexander the Great, Magellan or Amundsen ! These explorers left with hardly any equipment to map unknown regions. Technology has evolved but the will to understand the earth on which we live is still the same. Maps are essential, whether it be to impose the authority of a nation, to open commercial routes, to check the ownership of land, or just to find a bus station.<br><br>

In the 21st Century, mapping is done on computers. It might seem less glamourous but it drastically increases options. While Magellan had to wait for the right time and take several minutes to determine very approximately his position, we can now know our position in any town with a 5m precision ! We can follow the trajectories of dolphins during several years accross the Mediterranean. We can can find an epidemic's outbreak and propagation trail.

Flying by night! Saint-Exupéry marvelled at the Earth from his cockpit. This landscape has inspired authors as well as interested militaries, scientists, businessmen and of course cartographers! What is a map if not an aerial photograph? Airplanes, satellites, and drones take photos of the blue planet from every angle and in every state. Hundreds of thousands of sensors circle around it, day and night, capturing its colors, reflections, and contours. Initially used to locate enemy positions for bombing, aerial photography is now used to prepare urban construction sites, map archaeological excavations, measure the effects of climate change... and still marvel at the wonders produced by the Earth.
