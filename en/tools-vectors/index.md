<h2>Satellites</h2>

Placed in orbit around the Earth, they are sent to a specific altitude depending on their purpose. Geostationary satellites move at exactly the same speed as the Earth rotates on its axis. These satellites therefore remain constantly above the same region and continuously provide images of that same area. Other orbits offer different advantages. For example, sun-synchronous orbits allow the entire Earth to be examined over a period of time and the same point to be revisited at regular intervals.

<h2>Drones</h2>

They allow for much smaller areas to be surveyed and are more adaptable to very specific case studies.
